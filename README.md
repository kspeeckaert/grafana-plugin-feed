# Grafana plugin feed generator

Simple workflow that generates RSS feeds based on metadata from the [Grafana plugin catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/).

All you need to do is modify the `plugins.txt` to your liking, optionally change the scheduling of the workflow, and copy the URLs of the generated XML files into your favourite feed reader.
